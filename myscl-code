"And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete

Somethin'' was wrong I said, "What was goin'' on?"
I tried to break up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her"
She said, "If I can''t smoke none, she can''t either"

It ain''t no fun, if the homies can''t have none
Guess who''s back in the motherfuckin'' house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin'' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
''Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon'' do? You really don''t know
So I''d advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin'' damn well I''m too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop Doggy?
I''m all the above
I''m too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain''t no fun, if my homies can''t get a taste of it
''Cause you know I don''t love ''em
Woo! Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo'', red to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up bitch because I''m strugglin''
Just get on your knees and then start jugglin''
These motherfuckin'' nuts in your mouth
It''s me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (woo)
It ain''t no fun, if the homies can''t have none
It ain''t no fun, if the homies can''t have none
It ain''t no fun, if the homies can''t have none

For the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes
Know what I''m saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes
You''ll never go platinum!"
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga
We''d like to welcome y''all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y''all niggas know who I am, y''all niggas tearin'' up shit
But we got somethin'' old, and somethin'' new for y''all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
It''s like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I''m hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain''t no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door
Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven''t learnt
It''s the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I''m back
Hit em up, get ''em up, spit ''em up
Now, tell me, what''s going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off, shake off, now take off your
Clothes, and quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin'' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I''ll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You''se a flea, and I''m the Big Dogg
I''ll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin'' paws
Y''alls niggas better recognize
And see where I''m coming from: it''s still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y
It''s a crazy, mixed-up world
It''s a Doggy Dogg World
Well if you give me 10 bitches then I''ll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don''t slip, I''m for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain''t that something?
Talk shit and I''m dumping
I had the fuckin'' whole block bumpin''
Don''t sweat, but check the technique. I''m unique like China
You''ll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I''m coming through
1, 2, 3: you can''t see me
I''m a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin'' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It''s on again, It''s on and popping
All I see is green, so there ain''t no stopping
I wanna see some panties dropping
I''m coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I''m dishin out blues, I''m upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name''s often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it''s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it''s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I''m runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it''s on, I''m head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9''s for some action
You really don''t know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can''t do me, I''m goin out looney like O-Dog
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Til when? (Til the early morn'')
And it don''t stop, and it don''t quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough
Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin'' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hows with a fat dick
Til I die, I''m still screaming out: "bitches ain''t shit!"
Now I''m the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I''m from: Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that''s what the fuck you want
Then I blaze up the chronic so I can get high

You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin'' way too funny
Doin too much, y''know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck''s goin on wit you niggas, y''all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it''s time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I''m a stumble in like I don''t know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I''m takin off from the get-go
I ain''t givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I''ma tell you, man, that''s the worst
Fifth in the world, but I''ma keep my thang together

Laying everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you''ll go kick in
And that''s just the rules set by the fool from the ol'' school
When it''s time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y''all gon'' drop
If you''re quick on the draw you''re gon'' see the morgue
But if you''re too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit''s real
I ain''t no John Wayne, these niggas gang-bang
The Four Horsemen, that''s the click I''m wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we''re on a mission ta Kansas, slipping through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searching for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it''s 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

On and on and on it''s more strange
Time to heat, shooting range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at the Wild Horny Corral
I heard of ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain''t never lie
Besides I''m in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me want to bust
Back to the drawing down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get''cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can''t help it, I''m heartless, ya can''t hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I got''s lots o'' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I''m on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o'' course
It ain''t no stopping young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

Two sacks o'' money from the train heist
They ain''t even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my knapsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn''t have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I''m off into the sunset
Trying ta reach my destiny fast
It''s these two bags o'' cash
44''s cocked I ain''t making no mo'' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash ''em, uh

Dogs, we keep ''em, busters, we sweep ''em
And when it''s drama, my dogs''ll bite your mama

He got killed too, so I didn''t need him (damn, damn, damn)

Just last week, you know what? (Bitch) she bit the shit out of me
Man, that bitch is a trick, I had to get coffee
To get the bitch up off me
And I can''t tame her and I can''t blame her
That''s why I had to name her the Top Dogg Gamer

Talkin'' bout what could pop out and hit the roof

Man, that same bus stop is where
I dropped that bitch back the f*ck off

Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I don''t see a god damn thang
That''s stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
It''d look nice on my finger, I''m a buy you a zinger

You know I won''t cheat her, don''t mistreat her

Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin'' with a dog, bitch you ain''t fin'' to come up, hoe

Ain''t no tellin'' like Jack told Helen

Couldn''t spend on shit that ain''t valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin''
Told her I''m a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin'' me to do somethin'' for the time she spent

"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain''t No Fun", now check it

The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She haad a big [?] with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she''d always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"

Push a Lexus Coupe that''s extra cute
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please

He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that''s laid back
But back in the days he wasn''t nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he''s grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn''t like him as a child

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y''all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{Scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin''s Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there''s no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie''s like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don''t want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn''t
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn''t trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain''t run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they''d make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain''t never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don''t be amazed
You caught the vapors

For the bow-wow L-B-C style
Hit you like the Doggfather fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever

Check this out here man, I lick ''em, sic ''em
Man''s best friend, I hit you for ten, uh

You can''t make the party go "hip-hop"
And you can''t do your thing without usin'' mine
But yet and still, I see you on the grind
But I''m gon'' take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then you got lost
And if you get tossed, it''s on your own, it''s your own fault
See, I gots to get mine, I don''t drop no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on

Thinking many plots blossoms how amny times?
I''m sedated my "conscriptiated" from beginning
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my locs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach
To my bulls out in Philly cause all they smoke is phillies
Wit'' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in Darby tip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC''s like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click that''ll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catching cases,robberies and assaults
It ain''t my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact

When a nigga gotta strive for his he can''t stop
Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can''t stop
Gotta get somewhere

My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself
Put em to rest,confess nevertheless
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat
Any MC trying to f*ck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre
In ''96,with a different approach I''m shit
I got the flavor and I''m major,bust the ass
Niggas can''t stop us and can''t fade us
Shady ass niggas can''t stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I''m catchin ya
I bet ya I won''t let ya escape
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
I''m a L-B-C on through, staying true
Demanding my respect, respect is what I''ve given
So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Don''t catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock, gat, gun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can''t fade it
With the every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I''m stomping, stepping with my projectile weapon

Whats up "Jex" so''s eject the hum
When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must!If I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeating and deleting elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC''s who compose the violence
Bringing drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, something up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as "bombing ya",suffer from insomnia
And I''m a gonna be coming for you

And niggas don''t kill one another

Because a brother is a brother

They queens, righteous
Man, heaven must be like this
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime
Ain''t no peneteneries and ain''t nobody doin'' time
And oh, yeah, I''m the big O-K''er
I''m smarter than the senator
Bigger than the mayor
Heaven on Earth
It''s like a prayer
And you can''t get in without yo'' gold card
You got to be a player

You gots to be and I took you there
Pop goes the nine, we''ll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

These fuckin'' guys scream all of this shit, huh?
They want us to go out and come back in
And start this fuckin'' shit all over again, or somethin'', huh?
We got the fuckin'' money and they don''t got the fuckin'' stuff?
I tell you man, they fuck with Tray, ayo Daz Dillinger, Corleone (yeah)
They don''t know us
Vision eighty-eight kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Runnin'' illegal business, racketeering
Smugglin'', doin'' things from handling the gun is what they fearin''
Bodyguards and hitmans like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations, spots where it take place
If you short on my money, your ass is gettin'' filleted
There''s four major gangs that run the city of G''s
The Violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The Violators and Gambinos, they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone, we run downtown
Murder''s an every day thing in the city
Where you gotta clock chips, jack robberies and doin'' hits
Ton, Eighty, and Nate, in charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do our thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and ten shot
Buck ''em ''til they all drop, circle ''round the block
Let ''em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on they ass, commence to takin'' ''em out (out)
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infested with drugs, dope peddlers and addicts (yeah)
Gangs have taken over seventy-five percent of our town
As the young youth behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever
As the law enforcements have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From comin'' into our country, but they can''t
The murders have increased more than ninety-five percent
And the drug amount of which they make
Is more than seven hundred million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion
I had no choice or remorse when time for puttin'' it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin'' it pop
Young crook keepin'' hook, nigga shakin'' the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help, you help yourself ''cause ain''t no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only Gs and hoes
You hold on your heat for them fiendish foes
Trust, bust, be aware and I ain''t your curse
''Cause the niggas that I dared to''ll gank you first
Think I might be deceased ''fore I reach my callin''
But long as I''m haulin'', my heat I''m stallin'' (shh)
I bring it to you hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief with stripes
Don''t speak on the creep, move, fools is listenin''
And war story glory ain''t worth the riskin''
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent your set ''til you bite the deck
Who I be? I''m the Dee, nigga, check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I''m takin'' ''em out
Everybody, okay
Take a good fuckin'' look at the bad guy
It''s the last time you gonna see a bad guy look like this, huh
You know, I tell you, huh, Corleone
I come through blastin'', me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin'', may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot ''em down in front of Hassans
Should''ve known from the gate, who''s the baddest
In my zone, Don Corleone, wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U.S. seas I shift ki''s, a hundred and twenty plane rides
Multiplied by Gs, eighty-seven point three million in a matter of months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate, new empire to make
Toast, ''til we all die, ''til we burst and break
From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums
We ran out of dope, I don''t think so, son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark, gettin'' all the clucks to spark
From when I pick ''em off like darts, stab ''em in they hearts
Make an example, what I said, you end up dead
Spray the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost dogs
Never reach until I see the blue sky ''til I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me, myself, me, my dope, me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges, I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin'' crazy for drugs
I tellin'' you man, we do them good
And they don''t do us good back, huh
But you know what a hustle is Don Corleone?
A hustle is a pig that don''t fuckin'' fly straight, okay?
They wanna play rough, huh? They wanna play rough, okay
Say hello to my little fuckin'' friends
Okay, look at you now
You look like the fuckin'' cockroaches now

Tryin'' to spread a lil'' unity between you and me

Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g''s
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I''m having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I''m  tyring to get mine
Ain''t nothing to lose plus I''m living on the frontline
It''s a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin'' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot''em up till they come out
I''m blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I''m amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn''t in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don''t sell how shall we proceed
Because we can''t slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don''t sell how shall we proceed
Because we can''t slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let''em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn''t rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My ??? can''t chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin'' lives for less than twenty before

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I''m flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I''m bossin, and tossin''em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it''ll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that''s all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain''t worth being
Shot

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don''t sell how shall we proceed
Because we can''t slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don''t sell how shall we proceed
Because we can''t slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

Now look, I''m fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name

In front of his building with the rest of his friends

Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I''m off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin'' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool
Cause there''s no dollars for nothing else

So now its time I got to do something
I look for work

I do odd jobs
And come home like a slob
So here comes dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice

I got a 55" television you know
And every once in a while I hear "just say no"
Or the other commercial I love
That''s when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I''m not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car

Bustin shots hopping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout

And you won''t see nobody dare to try to boss or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced, pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully''ll boss him around

My kid ain''t even been born yet!
I can see him when he''s seventeen or so and startin'' in to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound, on the way to get ''round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
You can have fun with a son
But you got to be a father to a girl
She mighn''t be so bad, at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind of neat and petite little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!
My little girl, pink and white as peaches and cream is she
My little girl is half again as bright as girls were meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her, many a likely lad
Does what he can to woo her from her faithful dad
She has a few pink and white young fellas of two and three
But my little girl gets hungry ev''ry night and she comes home to me!
I gotta get ready before she comes
Gotta make certain that she won''t be dragged up in slums with a lot o'' bums like me
She''s gotta be sheltered and fed and dressed in the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money but, I''ll try, by God! I''ll try!
I''ll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!'),

I dearly wish that I could find more ways to live those words of his
Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country
But, whatever I try to give to my country it keeps giving right back to me
Compounded every hour on the hour
Only in America could all that''s happened to me, happen to a guy like me
Anywhere else I might have wound up digging coal
Or herding sheep or stuffing fortune cookies
All respectable enough jobs but I imagine, for me, a bit frustrating
My country has let me sing for my supper and then payed me for the food I eat
I''ve had my ups and downs, but who hasn''t?
But my low down downdest was certainly better than digging post holes
For the iron or bare bull curtain, and you''d better believe me buster
What is America to me?
A name, a map, a flag I see
A certain word, democracy
What is America to me?
The house I live in
A plot of earth, a street
The grocer and the butcher
And the people that I meet
The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races and religions
That''s America to me
A place I work in
A worker by my side
A little town or city
Where my people lived and died
The howdy and the handshake
The air of feeling free
And the right to speak my mind out
That''s America to me
The things I see about me
The big things and the small
The little corner newsstand
And the house a mile tall
The wedding and the churchyard
A laughter and the tears
And the dream that''s been a growing
For a hundred and eighty years
The town I live in
The street, the house, the room
Pavement of the city
Or a garden all in bloom
The church, the school, the clubhouse
The millions lights I see
But especially the people

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand

It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom

There are men here that don''t ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray

And I thank the Lord for helpin'' me each day
Now there''s greystone chapel here at Folsom

Voices callin'', voices cryin''

The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn trees

And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him'),

Well, If They Freed Me From This

I Bet I''d Move On Over A Little Farther Down The Line,
Far From Folsom Prison, That''s Where I Want To Stay,
And I''d Let That Lonesome Whistle

Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine
You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine
When that old judge looked down at me
Said I put you in that penitentiary Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time

Well, now it won''t be long, just a few more days

She gives me first degree
She really satisfies me
Love me till I''m legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War
You know I''m losin'' sleep
I''m in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can''t live without it
The girl''s got rhythm (girl''s got rhythm)
The girl''s got rhythm (girl''s got rhythm)
She''s got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl''s got rhythm
You know she moves like sin
And when she lets me in
It''s like liquid love
